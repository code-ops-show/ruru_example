# RURU EXAMPLE

This is an example of ruby calling rust code via `ruru`

Current Environment Version
 - `rustc 1.13.0`
 - `cargo 0.13.0-nightly`

to run this example please run:

```
bundle install
```

then run

```
cargo build --release
```

then run

```
ruby calculator.rb
```

This is a very simple example. I just wanted to provide a structure to show how it works.
